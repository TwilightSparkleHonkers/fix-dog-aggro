Allow Wolves to Attack teammates
=======

This mod fixes the issue where wolves won't defend their owner nor follow their owner's attack if the target is in the same team. This is particularly useful in conjunction with life series mods, which usually assign players to teams based on their life counts (red, yellow, green).

**NOTE THAT THIS MOD IS EXPERIMENTAL AND WILL AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHER MOBS AS WELL. IF YOU USE TEAMS IN ANY MORE ADVANCED WAY THAN JUST COLORED NAMETAGS, PLEASE CHECK THAT THIS MOD DOES NOT BREAK STUFF.** The fix affects *any* mob to aggro *any* other mob of the same team. I have literally done 5 minutes of testing, so the chance that this breaks something is very high (pillagers/raiders might attack each other, maybe piglins too, idrk).

Platform
==========
- Neoforge
- 1.21.4
NOTE: It's like 20 lines of code, you can probably port it very easily to Fabric  and other mod loaders/versions
